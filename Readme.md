# Matrix Solving Techinques Using Matlab ðŸ”¢ðŸ“ˆ

**The project involves using Matlab to analyze non-linear equations. The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of the equations by using computer-aided numerical analysis and visualizing the results through graphs and charts.**

## Explaination ðŸ“–

### Why we need different techinques to solve a matrix?

Matrix solving is a crucial aspect of linear algebra and plays a major role in fields like engineering, physics, and finance. This project presents an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of various matrix solving techniques and to apply them using MATLAB. By comparing the performance and accuracy of different methods, the project provides insights into the best approach for solving matrices in different situations.

### Numerical Methods to solve equations ðŸš€

- Gauss-Seidel
- Gauss-Elimination
- LU Decomposition

### Code Need to Know ðŸ“Š

> You can find the implementation of each code and it's psuedocode in the techinques.m
